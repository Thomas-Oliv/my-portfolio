description: First post in a series revolving around my keypad development process.

I really wanted to do something different this coop term and put my free time to good use rather than playing Apex.  After taking ECE 298 and ECE 224 I really got interested in low-level programming/firmware for embedded projects. I started brainstorming what I could create with my current knowledge while also learning a few new things and I stumbled across the idea of making a keypad/macro keyboard (I'll be using these terms interchangably). Looking online it seems quite a bit of people have thought the same but my goal is a bit bigger. My goal is to have a few features:

<ul>

<li>Wireless keypad with seamless bluetooth pairing.</li>

<li>A good sized battery for long use between charges.</li>

<li>4x4 key matrix for lots of functionality.</li>

<li>Battery saving features such as auto shut off or low power states to conserve battery charge.</li>

<li>Bluetooth flashing for firmware via an easy to use flashing tool.</li>

<li>GUI to easily configure the macros and key bindings.</li>

<li>An on/off button.</li>

<li>Use cherry MX switches.</li>

<li>Design as much of the hardware and software as I can by myself with minimal external resources.</li>

</ul>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Controller-customizable/dp/B06XKNZT1P">Elgato streamdeck</a> is around $200 CAD so the overall cost for development should definitely be well below that. I will be creating more posts soon updating my progress with development as well as all the tools I have to help me achieve this goal.
