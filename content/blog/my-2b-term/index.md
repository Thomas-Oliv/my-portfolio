Hello!

I'm starting my 2B term soon! Sadly it's still online but also I'm kind of glad since I took a leap of faith and decided to move out to British Columbia for the term to live with my sister. I've lived in Ontario all my life and this is the first time I'll be going out of Ontario! I did some budgeting and I realized that it would be much cheaper to live with my sister than find my own place in Waterloo even if it meant moving across the country! I also took this as a way to stretch my feet and experience the rest of Canada while still having the support of my family around me. I know that in the future, I may have to move out of Ontario for work or co-op so by moving out now, I can prepare myself for the future when I will be on my own. I'm happy I have the support of my family as I couldn't have done this alone. I'll try to post more about my adventures here as BC is a beautiful province with lots to do and many mountains to climb!

P.S. This is my first blog post so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right! :)
