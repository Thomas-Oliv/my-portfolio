### **PLC Data Storage Device**

*Co-op Project*

* Researched, Designed, and tested an industrial data collection device to store machine performance metrics.
* The device can read data from the PLC and migrate the data to the cloud for storage in near real-time.
* Implemented the engineering design process to select the most optimal design.

### **Anime Schedule Bot**

*Personal Project*

* Built a discord bot in python to track and notify users when certain anime releasing.
* Users can search for and track specific shows.
* Uses MySQL database to store user data.

### **Dawn of Ducks**

*Personal Project*

* Programmed a 2D side-scrolling game in Python and Java.
* Includes different enemy types, GUI, animations, sound, and projectiles.

### **Portfolio/Blog Website**

*Personal Project*

* Developed a portfolio and blog website for myself to showcase my achievements, projects, and experience.
* Created using the Gatsby framework and Netlify CMS to manage the site content.

### **HVAC System**

*School Project*

* Designed an HVAC system in VHDL using emulsiV.
* The system takes in digital sensor data and creates the corresponding digital output to adjust the temperature.
* Based on the RISC-V architecture.

### **PNG Image Merger**

*School Project*

* Built a C++ program that uses multithreading to pull PNG image segments from the web asynchronously and then merge them once all the segments have been acquired.
* Validated functionality through unit testing, Valgrind, and Helgrind to ensure there are no memory leaks or race conditions respectively.

### **Home Security System**

*School Project*

* In the process of designing a home security system in Proteus.
* Designed and validated sensors, actuators, and user interfaces as well as translation circuits to ensure compatibility with the STM32 MCU.
* In the future, the MCU will be programmed to interact with the I/O devices according to the project specifications.
